A while ago a couple of my mates decided they loved the look of this pudding:

As you probably just witnessed, it's a weird, wobbly pudding thats pretty massive! Look a massive creme caramel that wobbles to and fro. 

So after watching the video many, many times, they bought the pudding from Japan. It was imported and after waiting a while they received it in the post. It arrived in a bucket! xD In the bucket you set the pudding for at least 10 hours. They struggled a little bit because the instructions weren't actually in English, so they had to try and Google how to make it. After setting it, they opened the lid and flipped it. It was a bit like jelly! 

To top it off you are then meant to pour this iodine sugar syrup on top. I think you're then meant to set it again in the fridge, however we just dug in!

A lovely nutricious treat!haha

There were at least 15 of us eating it and we struggled! It was like the size of a sandcastle, so not massive. It tasted like cream and sugar. 



Giga giga!!!
